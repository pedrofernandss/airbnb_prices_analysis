## Results

Based on the explored data, it is evident that there is no strict price stratification by region in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In other words, affordable and luxurious rooms or apartments can be found in various locations.

However, entire apartments tend to have the highest prices on average compared to other categories, and rentals typically last for an average of 5 days.

In addition to this, neighborhoods such as Acari, Magalh√£es Bastos, and Manguinhos emerge as the preferred choices among platform users. Interestingly, none of these neighborhoods were among the top 10 in terms of the highest rental prices.

Given the low correlation between all numerical variables, we chose not to employ machine learning techniques for predictive purposes.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market in Rio de Janeiro, helping both travelers and hosts make informed decisions.
Thank you for exploring our project!
